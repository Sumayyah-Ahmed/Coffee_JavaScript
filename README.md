# Coffee_JavaScript
I created this website using HTML CSS & JavaScript. It was a very interesting project for me since I love to drink coffee and tea, so I created this website as my favorite hobby. We (students) were not allowed to use any logo or pictures for their website. To make it beautiful, I put Multiple options to pick from the menu, a Countdown timer for the Party, and a form to fill out for joining. Since it is for a shop, the calculator calculates the total amount as soon as the user picks an option, the website asks for location to use the map, and the website title changes color while being touched. Lastly, I added a few links for safe web browsing. I love this website, have a look.
